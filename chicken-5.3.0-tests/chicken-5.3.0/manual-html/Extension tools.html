A specification of the egg description file format is <a href="Egg%20specification%20format.html">here</a>.</p><h3 id="sec:Security"><a href="#sec:Security">Security</a></h3><p>When eggs are downloaded and installed one is executing code from potentially compromised systems. This applies also when <tt>chicken-install</tt> executes system tests for required eggs. As the code has been retrieved over the network effectively untrusted code is going to be evaluated. When <tt>chicken-install</tt> is run as <i>root</i> the whole system is at the mercy of the build instructions (note that this is also the case every time you install software via <tt>sudo make install</tt>, so this is not specific to the CHICKEN egg mechanism).</p><p>Security-conscious users should never run <tt>chicken-install</tt> as root. A simple remedy is to keep the repository inside a user's home directory (see the section &quot;Changing repository location&quot; below). Alternatively obtain write/execute access to the default location of the repository (usually <tt>/usr/local/lib/chicken</tt>) to avoid running as root. <tt>chicken-install</tt> also provides a <tt>-sudo</tt> option to perform the last installation steps as root user, but do building and other .setup script processing as normal. A third solution is to override <tt>VARDIR</tt> when building the system (for example by passing <tt>&quot;VARDIR=/foo/bar&quot;</tt> on the make command line, or by modifying <tt>config.make</tt>. Eggs will then be installed in <tt>$(VARDIR)/chicken/8</tt>.</p><h3 id="sec:Changing_the_repository_location"><a href="#sec:Changing_the_repository_location">Changing the repository location</a></h3><p>When CHICKEN is installed a repository for eggs is created and initialized in a default location (usually something like <tt>/usr/local/lib/chicken/9/</tt>). It is possible to keep an egg repository in another location. This can be configured at build-time by passing <tt>VARDIR=&lt;directory&gt;</tt> to <tt>make(3)</tt> or by modifying the <tt>config.make</tt> configuration file. If you want to override this location after chicken is installed, you can create a repository directory, set the <tt>CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY</tt> and/or <tt>CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH</tt> environment variables to the full path of the new reopsitory and copy all files from the default repository into the new one.</p><p>Note that your binary version can differ from the one given in the examples here, if your chicken version is older or newer than the one used in these examples. Check your default location for the correct binary-version number.</p><p><tt>CHICKEN_REPOSITORY_PATH</tt> is a directory (or a list of directories separated by <tt>:</tt>/<tt>;</tt>) where eggs are to be loaded from for all chicken-based programs. <tt>CHICKEN_INSTALL_REPOSITORY</tt> is the place where eggs will be installed and which the egg-related tools like <tt>chicken-install</tt>, <tt>chicken-uninstall</tt> and <tt>chicken-status</tt> consult and update. Make sure the paths given in these environment variables are absolute and not relative.</p><h3 id="sec:Static_linking"><a href="#sec:Static_linking">Static linking</a></h3><p>Static linking of extensions and programs is fully supported and should be transparent to the user. Every extension will by default be compiled into a dynamically loadable and a statically linkable entity. By passing <tt>-static</tt> on the <tt>csc</tt> command-line, eggs that are available in static form will be linked instead of the dynamically loadable version. Use the <tt>linkage</tt> egg description property to select in what modes a component should be built.</p><p>To identify the necessary object files during linking of extensions, <tt>csc</tt> creates so-called &quot;link files&quot; and installs them along the statically compiled object file in the local egg repository. These link files specify what objects should be linked when an application is using a static variant of an extension.</p><h3 id="sec:Locations"><a href="#sec:Locations">Locations</a></h3><p>For experimentation or in-house builds of software it may be useful to have private egg repositories in addition to the official CHICKEN egg repository. This can be accomplished by defining so-called &quot;locations&quot;, directories that contain egg source-code and description files and which should be scanned before trying to retrieve an egg via the network.</p><p>The file <tt>&lt;PREFIX&gt;/share/chicken/setup.defaults</tt> holds various parameters that define where eggs should be downloaded, together with more obscure options, and can be used to customize the sources where eggs will be retrieved from. Adding a line of the form</p><p><tt>(location &quot;&lt;PATH&gt;&quot;)</tt></p><p>will add <tt>&lt;PATH&gt;</tt> as an additional egg source, where <tt>&lt;PATH&gt;</tt> should be a directory in the local filesystem that contains any number of eggs, one directory for each, including the source code and the <tt>.egg</tt> files for each egg.</p><p>Locations are searched before trying to retrieve from the network. Any number of locations may be defined.</p><h3 id="sec:The_egg_cache"><a href="#sec:The_egg_cache">The egg cache</a></h3><p>Eggs are downloaded and built in the so called &quot;egg cache&quot;, an intermediate location used for storing already downloaded source code and for providing a temporary location for building the eggs before they are installed.</p><p>By default the cache is located in the directory <tt>.chicken-install/cache</tt> in the user's home directory (<tt>$HOME</tt> on UNIX, or <tt>%USERPROFILE%</tt> on Windows. If the respective environment variable is not set, then <tt>/tmp</tt> or <tt>/Temp</tt> is used.</p><p>Built extensions and programs remain in the cache, to avoid rebuilding already compiled code and multiple downloads of eggs in case the installation of an egg fails - the dependencies will be cached after the first download and re-download is not needed.</p><p><tt>chicken-install</tt> tries to take extreme care to avoid stale binaries, but should you be in doubt, simply delete the directory, or run <tt>chicken-install -purge</tt> to clear the cache or parts of it.</p><p>You can override the location of the cache by setting the <tt>CHICKEN_EGG_CACHE</tt> environment variable.</p><h3 id="sec:Egg_installation_in_detail"><a href="#sec:Egg_installation_in_detail">Egg installation in detail</a></h3><h4 id="sec:Retrieval"><a href="#sec:Retrieval">Retrieval</a></h4><p>First the egg names given on the command line (or, if no arguments are given, all eggs identified by <tt>.egg</tt> files in the current directory, including any in a subdirectory named <tt>chicken</tt>) must be retrieved, either from a local source or from the official egg repository. Should the egg exist in the egg cache we check whether this cached version is out of date. A cached egg is considered out of date, if a) it is locally available and all cached files belonging to the egg do not have newer timestamps than the local files, or b) if it is a remotely retrieved egg and no newer versions exist on the remote egg server and the last time the cache was filled from the remote location is not later than one hour. Additionally, if any changes in certain environment variables that may influence the compilation of an egg, or if the CHICKEN version changed, then retrieval of the egg sources is enforced in any case.</p><p>If the egg is in the current directory, or in a &quot;location&quot; (as described above), the files are copied into the cache. If the egg is remotely available, then it is retrieved via HTTP from one of the egg servers defined in <tt>setup.defaults</tt>.</p><p>Once the egg sources are retrieved and stored in the cache, their <tt>.egg</tt> files are loaded and validated. After this any egg dependencies are resolved and located in the cache, triggering a recursive retrieval, if necessary.</p><h4 id="sec:Preparation"><a href="#sec:Preparation">Preparation</a></h4><p>Unless the <tt>-retrieve</tt> option was given, the eggs intended to be built and installed are now scheduled for compilation. The egg information from the <tt>.egg</tt> files is processed and translated into build and install scripts for the current platform - if this CHICKEN was configured for cross compilation, and no separate host- or target-build was selected, two sets of build/install scripts will be generated, one for the host system and one for the target.</p><h4 id="sec:Building_and_installation"><a href="#sec:Building_and_installation">Building and installation</a></h4><p>Unless <tt>-dry-run</tt> was given on the command-line, the build- and install scripts are now executed, ordered by the dependency relationships between the full set of eggs that are scheduled for compilation. If the <tt>-test</tt> option was given and a file named <tt>run.scm</tt> exists in the <tt>tests</tt> subdirectory of the egg sources, then this script is executed. Should it terminate with an error or a non-zero exit code, the installation is still performed and <tt>chicken-install</tt> does not abort. Only after all scheduled eggs have been installed, <tt>chicken-install</tt> will terminate with a non-zero exit code.</p><p>Note that the build process attempts to minimize re-building of already compiled files in the cache, using the <tt>chicken-do</tt> program. See the manual page for <tt>chicken-do</tt> for more details.</p><p>From the egg-information in the <tt>.egg</tt> file, the set of files installed for a particular egg are added to the egg-information and stored together with the build-artifacts produced by the build scripts.</p><h3 id="sec:chicken-install_reference"><a href="#sec:chicken-install_reference">chicken-install reference</a></h3><p>Available options:</p><dl><dt><tt>-h   -help</tt></dt>
