<div id="main"><h2 id="sec:Getting_started_"><a href="#sec:Getting_started_">Getting started </a></h2><p>CHICKEN is a compiler that translates Scheme source files into C, which in turn can be fed to a C compiler to generate a standalone executable.  An interpreter is also available and can be used as a scripting environment or for testing programs before compilation.</p><p>This chapter is designed to get you started with CHICKEN programming, describing what it is and what it will do for you, and covering basic use of the system. With almost everything discussed here, there is more to the story, which the remainder of the manual reveals. Here, we only cover enough to get you started. Nonetheless, someone who knows Scheme already should be able to use this chapter as the basis for writing and running small CHICKEN programs.</p><h3 id="sec:Scheme"><a href="#sec:Scheme">Scheme</a></h3><p>Scheme is a member of the Lisp family of languages, of which Common Lisp, Emacs Lisp and Clojure are other widely-known members. As with Lisp dialects, Scheme features</p><ul><li>a wide variety of programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and object-oriented</li>
<li>a very simple syntax, based upon nested parenthesization </li>
<li>the ability to extend the language in meaningful and useful ways</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to Common Lisp, Scheme is very minimal, and tries to include only those features absolutely necessary in programming. In contrast to Emacs Lisp, Scheme is not anchored into a single program (Emacs), and has a more modern and elegant language design. In contrast to Clojure, Scheme provides only a very minimal set of concepts but allows them to be used in very general ways with few restrictions.</p><p>Scheme is defined in a document called <i>The Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme</i>, or <i>R5RS</i> for short. (Yes, it really has been revised five times, so an expanded version of its name would be <i>The Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Report</i>.)  A newer report, <i>R6RS</i>, was released in 2007, but this report has attracted considerable controversy, and a number of Scheme implementations have chosen not to be compliant with it. Yet another report was released in 2013 (&quot;R7RS&quot;), that was less ambitious than R6RS and more minimal.</p><p>CHICKEN fully complies with R5RS and, by using a separately available extension also with the &quot;R7RS small&quot; language.</p><p>Even though Scheme is consciously minimalist, it is recognized that a language must be more than a minimal core in order to be useful. Accordingly, the Scheme community uses a process known as `Scheme Requests For Implementation' (SRFI, pronounced `SUR-fee') to define new language features. A typical Scheme system therefore complies with one of the Scheme reports plus some or all of the accepted SRFIs.</p><p>A good starting point for Scheme knowledge is <a href="http://www.schemers.org">http://www.schemers.org</a>. There you will find the defining reports, FAQs, lists of useful books and other resources, and the SRFIs.</p><h3 id="sec:CHICKEN"><a href="#sec:CHICKEN">CHICKEN</a></h3><p>CHICKEN Scheme combines an optimising compiler with a reasonably fast interpreter.  It supports almost all of R7RS and the important SRFIs. The compiler generates portable C code that supports tail recursion, first-class continuations and lightweight threads, and the interface to and from C libraries is flexible, efficient, and easy to use.  There are hundreds of contributed CHICKEN libraries that make the programmer's task easier.  The interpreter allows interactive use, fast prototyping, debugging, and scripting.  The active and helpful CHICKEN community fixes bugs and provides support.  Extensive documentation is supplied.</p><p>CHICKEN was developed by Felix L. Winkelmann over the period from 2000 through 2007. In early 2008, Felix asked the community to take over the responsibility of developing and maintaining the system, though he still takes a strong interest in it, and participates actively.</p><p>CHICKEN includes</p><ul><li>a Scheme interpreter that supports all of R5(7)RS Scheme, with only a few relatively minor omissions, and with many extensions</li>
<li>a compatible compiler whose target is C, thus making porting to new machines and architectures relatively straightforward</li>
<li>the C support allows Scheme code to include `embedded' C code, thus making it easy to invoke host OS or library functions</li>
<li>a framework for language extensions, library modules that broaden the functionality of the system</li>
</ul>
<p>This package is distributed under the <b>BSD license</b> and as such is free to use and modify as long as the original authors are acknowledged.</p><p>Scheme cognoscenti will appreciate the method of compilation and the design of the runtime-system, which follow closely Henry Baker's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200223051632/http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/CheneyMTA.html">CONS Should Not CONS Its Arguments, Part II: Cheney on the M.T.A.</a> paper and expose a number of interesting properties.</p><ul><li>Consing (creation of data on the heap) is inexpensive, because a generational garbage collection scheme is used in combination with allocating on the C stack, in which short-lived data structures are reclaimed extremely quickly.</li>
<li>Moreover, <tt>call-with-current-continuation</tt> involves only minimal overhead and CHICKEN does not suffer under any performance penalties if first-class continuations are used in complex ways.</li>
</ul>
<p>The generated C code fully supports tail-call optimization (TCO).</p><p>Some of the features supported by CHICKEN:</p><ul><li>Lightweight threads based on first-class continuations</li>
<li>Record structures</li>
<li>Extended comment- and string-literal syntaxes</li>
<li>Libraries for regular expressions, string handling</li>
<li>UNIX system calls and extended data structures</li>
<li>Compiled C files can be easily distributed</li>
<li>Allows the creation of fully self-contained statically linked executables</li>
<li>On systems that support it, compiled code can be loaded dynamically</li>
<li>Built-in support for cross-compilation</li>
</ul>
<p>CHICKEN has been used in many environments ranging from embedded systems through desktop machines to large-scale server deployments. The number of language extensions, or <b>eggs</b>, is constantly growing:</p><ul><li>extended language features</li>
<li>development tools, such as documentation generators, debugging, and automated testing libraries</li>
<li>interfaces to other languages such as Java, Python, and Objective-C</li>
<li>interfaces to database systems, GUIs, and other libraries, </li>
<li>network applications, such as servers and clients for ftp, smtp/pop3, irc, and http</li>
<li>web servers and related tools, including URL parsing, HTML generation, AJAX, and HTTP session management</li>
<li>data formats, including XML, JSON, and Unicode support</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter provides you with an overview of the entire system, with enough information to get started writing and running small Scheme programs.</p><h3 id="sec:CHICKEN_repositories.2c_websites_and_community"><a href="#sec:CHICKEN_repositories.2c_websites_and_community">CHICKEN repositories, websites and community</a></h3><p>The master CHICKEN website is <a href="http://www.call-cc.org">http://www.call-cc.org</a>. Here you can find basic information about CHICKEN, downloads and pointers to other key resources.</p><p>The CHICKEN wiki (<a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org">http://wiki.call-cc.org</a>) contains the most current version of the User's manual, along with various tutorials and other useful documents. The list of eggs is at <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/egg-index">http://wiki.call-cc.org/egg-index</a>.</p><p>A very useful search facility for questions about procedures and syntax available for CHICKEN can be found at <a href="http://api.call-cc.org">http://api.call-cc.org</a>. The CHICKEN issue tracker is at <a href="http://bugs.call-cc.org">http://bugs.call-cc.org</a>.</p><p>The CHICKEN community has two major mailing lists. If you are a CHICKEN user, <tt>chicken-users</tt> (<a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/chicken-users">http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/chicken-users</a>) will be of interest. The crew working on the CHICKEN system itself uses the very low-volume <tt>chicken-hackers</tt> list (<a href="http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/chicken-hackers">http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/chicken-hackers</a>) for communication.  For other topic-specific mailing lists (e.g., announcements, security) and discussion groups, see <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/discussion-groups">http://wiki.call-cc.org/discussion-groups</a>.</p><p>There is also an IRC channel (<tt>#chicken</tt>) on <a href="http://libera.chat">Libera.Chat</a>.</p><h3 id="sec:Installing_CHICKEN"><a href="#sec:Installing_CHICKEN">Installing CHICKEN</a></h3><p>CHICKEN is available as C sources. Refer to the <tt>README</tt> file in the distribution for instructions on installing it on your system.</p><p>Because it compiles to C, CHICKEN requires that a C compiler be installed on your system. (If you're not writing embedded C code, you can pretty much ignore the C compiler once you have installed it.)</p><ul><li>On a Linux system, a C toolchain (e.g., GCC, clang) should be installed as part of the basic operating system, or should be available through the package management system (e.g., APT, Synaptic, RPM, or Yum, depending upon your Linux distribution).</li>
<li>On Macintosh OS X, you will need the XCode tools, which are  installable from the App Store.</li>
<li>On Windows, you have three choices:</li>
<li>Cygwin (<a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">https://www.cygwin.com/</a>) provides a relatively full-featured Unix environment for Windows.  CHICKEN works substantially the same in Cygwin and Unix.</li>
<li>The GNU Compiler Collection has been ported to Windows, in the MinGW system (<a href="http://mingw-w64.org/">http://mingw-w64.org/</a>). Unlike Cygwin, executables produced with MinGW do not need the Cygwin DLLs in order to run.   MSYS is a companion package to MinGW; it provides a minimum Unix-style development/build environment, again ported from free software.</li>
<li>You can build CHICKEN either with MinGW alone or with MinGW plus  MSYS. Both approaches produce a CHICKEN built against the mingw headers and libraries. The only difference is the environment where you actually run make. <tt>Makefile.mingw</tt> can be used in <tt>cmd.exe</tt> with the version of make that comes with mingw.  <tt>Makefile.mingw-msys</tt> uses unix commands such as <tt>cp</tt> and <tt>rm</tt>.  The end product is the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the <tt>README</tt> file for the version you're installing for more information on the installation process.</p><p>Alternatively, third party packages in binary format are available. See <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/platforms">http://wiki.call-cc.org/platforms</a> for information about how to obtain them.</p><h3 id="sec:Development_environments"><a href="#sec:Development_environments">Development environments</a></h3><p>The simplest development environment is a text editor and terminal window (Windows: Command Prompt, OSX: Terminal, Linux/Unix: xterm) for using the interpreter and/or invoking the compiler.  If you install one of the line editing extensions (e.g., <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/egg/breadline">breadline</a>, <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/egg/linenoise">linenoise</a>), you have some useful command line editing features in the interpreter (e.g., Emacs or vi-compatible line editing, customization).</p><p>It will be helpful to use a text editor that knows Scheme; it can be painful with editors that don't do parenthesis matching and automatic indentation.</p><p>In the rest of this chapter, we'll assume that you are using an editor of your choice and a regular terminal window for executing your CHICKEN code.</p><h3 id="sec:The_Read-Eval-Print_loop"><a href="#sec:The_Read-Eval-Print_loop">The Read-Eval-Print loop</a></h3><p>To invoke the CHICKEN interpreter, you use the <tt>csi</tt> command.</p><pre>$ csi

The REPL's prompt can be customized (see the <a href="Using%20the%20interpreter.html">Using the interpreter</a>) but the default prompt, showing the number of the form, is quite convenient.</p><p>The REPL also supports debugging commands: input lines beginning with a <tt>,</tt> (comma) are treated as special commands.

We access <tt>fib</tt> by defining a <tt>foreign-lambda</tt> for it, in this case saying that the function takes one integer argument (the <tt>int</tt> after the function name), and that it returns an integer result (the <tt>int</tt> before.) Now we can invoke <tt>xfib</tt> as though it were an ordinary Scheme function.</p><pre>$ gcc -c fib.c
