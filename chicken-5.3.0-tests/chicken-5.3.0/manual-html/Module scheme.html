Such a keyword gives a special meaning to the <tt>&lt;formal&gt;</tt> it precedes.

&lt;keyword-parameter&gt; ==&gt; &lt;ident&gt;
                        | (&lt;ident&gt; &lt;initializer&gt;)
&lt;initializer&gt; ==&gt; &lt;expr&gt;</pre><p>When a procedure is applied to a list of arguments, the parameters and arguments are processed from left to right as follows:</p><ul><li>Required-parameters are bound to successive arguments starting with the first argument. It shall be an error if there are fewer arguments than required-parameters.</li>
<li>Next, the optional-parameters are bound with the remaining arguments. If there are fewer arguments than optional-parameters, then the remaining optional-parameters are bound to the result of the evaluation of their corresponding &lt;initializer&gt;, if one was specified, otherwise <tt>#f</tt>. The corresponding &lt;initializer&gt; is evaluated in an environment in which all previous parameters have been bound.</li>
<li>If there is a rest-parameter, then it is bound to a list containing all the remaining arguments left over after the argument bindings with required-parameters and optional-parameters have been made. </li>
<li>If <tt>#!key</tt> was specified in the parameter-list, there should be an even number of remaining arguments. These are interpreted as a series of pairs, where the first member of each pair is a keyword specifying the parameter name, and the second member is the corresponding value. If the same keyword occurs more than once in the list of arguments, then the corresponding value of the first keyword is the binding value. If there is no argument for a particular keyword-parameter, then the variable is bound to the result of evaluating &lt;initializer&gt;, if one was specified, otherwise <tt>#f</tt>. The corresponding &lt;initializer&gt; is evaluated in an environment in which all previous parameters have been bound. </li>
</ul>
<p>Needing a special mention is the close relationship between the rest-parameter and possible keyword-parameters.  Declaring a rest-parameter binds up all remaining arguments in a list, as described above. These same remaining arguments are also used for attempted matches with declared keyword-parameters, as described above, in which case a matching keyword-parameter binds to the corresponding value argument at the same time that both the keyword and value arguments are added to the rest parameter list.  Note that for efficiency reasons, the keyword-parameter matching does nothing more than simply attempt to match with pairs that may exist in the remaining arguments.  Extra arguments that don't match are simply unused and forgotten if no rest-parameter has been declared.  Because of this, the caller of a procedure containing one or more keyword-parameters cannot rely on any kind of system error to report wrong keywords being passed in.</p><p>It shall be an error for an <tt>&lt;ident&gt;</tt> to appear more than once in a parameter-list.</p><p>If there is no rest-parameter and no keyword-parameters in the parameter-list, then it shall be an error for any extra arguments to be passed to the procedure.</p><p>Example:</p><pre>((lambda x x) 3 4 5 6)       =&gt; (3 4 5 6)

Built-in procedures that can easily be written in terms of other built-in procedures are identified as &quot;library procedures&quot;.</p><p>A program may use a top-level definition to bind any variable.

Until Common Lisp there was no carefully thought out strategy for organizing numerical computation, and with the exception of the MacLisp system [20] little effort was made to execute numerical code efficiently. This report recognizes the excellent work of the Common Lisp committee and accepts many of their recommendations. In some ways this report simplifies and generalizes their proposals in a manner consistent with the purposes of Scheme.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between the mathematical numbers, the Scheme numbers that attempt to model them, the machine representations used to implement the Scheme numbers, and notations used to write numbers. This report uses the types number, complex, real, rational, and integer to refer to both mathematical numbers and Scheme numbers. Machine representations such as fixed point and floating point are referred to by names such as fixnum and flonum.</p><h4 id="sec:Numerical_types"><a href="#sec:Numerical_types">Numerical types</a></h4><p>Mathematically, numbers may be arranged into a tower of subtypes in which each level is a subset of the level above it:</p><pre>   number
   complex
   real
   rational
   integer</pre><p>For example, 3 is an integer. Therefore 3 is also a rational, a real, and a complex. The same is true of the Scheme numbers that model 3. For Scheme numbers, these types are defined by the predicates number?, complex?, real?, rational?, and integer?.</p><p>There is no simple relationship between a number's type and its representation inside a computer. Although most implementations of Scheme will offer at least two different representations of 3, these different representations denote the same integer.</p><p>Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract data, as independent of their representation as possible. Although an implementation of Scheme may use fixnum, flonum, and perhaps other representations for numbers, this should not be apparent to a casual programmer writing simple programs.</p><p>It is necessary, however, to distinguish between numbers that are represented exactly and those that may not be. For example, indexes into data structures must be known exactly, as must some polynomial coefficients in a symbolic algebra system. On the other hand, the results of measurements are inherently inexact, and irrational numbers may be approximated by rational and therefore inexact approximations. In order to catch uses of inexact numbers where exact numbers are required, Scheme explicitly distinguishes exact from inexact numbers. This distinction is orthogonal to the dimension of type.</p><h4 id="sec:Exactness"><a href="#sec:Exactness">Exactness</a></h4><p>Scheme numbers are either exact or inexact. A number is exact if it was written as an exact constant or was derived from exact numbers using only exact operations. A number is inexact if it was written as an inexact constant, if it was derived using inexact ingredients, or if it was derived using inexact operations. Thus inexactness is a contagious property of a number. If two implementations produce exact results for a computation that did not involve inexact intermediate results, the two ultimate results will be mathematically equivalent. This is generally not true of computations involving inexact numbers since approximate methods such as floating point arithmetic may be used, but it is the duty of each implementation to make the result as close as practical to the mathematically ideal result.</p><p>Rational operations such as + should always produce exact results when given exact arguments. If the operation is unable to produce an exact result, then it may either report the violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an inexact value. See <a href="#sec:implementation-restrictions">the next section</a>.</p><p>With the exception of inexact-&gt;exact, the operations described in this section must generally return inexact results when given any inexact arguments. An operation may, however, return an exact result if it can prove that the value of the result is unaffected by the inexactness of its arguments. For example, multiplication of any number by an exact zero may produce an exact zero result, even if the other argument is inexact.</p><h4 id="sec:Implementation_restrictions"><a href="#sec:Implementation_restrictions">Implementation restrictions</a></h4><p>Implementations of Scheme are not required to implement the whole tower of subtypes given under &quot;<a href="#sec:Numerical_types">Numerical types</a>&quot;, but they must implement a coherent subset consistent with both the purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language. For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real may still be quite useful.</p><p>Implementations may also support only a limited range of numbers of any type, subject to the requirements of this section. The supported range for exact numbers of any type may be different from the supported range for inexact numbers of that type. For example, an implementation that uses flonums to represent all its inexact real numbers may support a practically unbounded range of exact integers and rationals while limiting the range of inexact reals (and therefore the range of inexact integers and rationals) to the dynamic range of the flonum format. Furthermore the gaps between the representable inexact integers and rationals are likely to be very large in such an implementation as the limits of this range are approached.</p><p>An implementation of Scheme must support exact integers throughout the range of numbers that may be used for indexes of lists, vectors, and strings or that may result from computing the length of a list, vector, or string. The length, vector-length, and string-length procedures must return an exact integer, and it is an error to use anything but an exact integer as an index. Furthermore any integer constant within the index range, if expressed by an exact integer syntax, will indeed be read as an exact integer, regardless of any implementation restrictions that may apply outside this range. Finally, the procedures listed below will always return an exact integer result provided all their arguments are exact integers and the mathematically expected result is representable as an exact integer within the implementation:</p><pre>+            -             *
quotient     remainder     modulo
max          min           abs
numerator    denominator   gcd
lcm          floor         ceiling
truncate     round         rationalize
expt</pre><p>Implementations are encouraged, but not required, to support exact integers and exact rationals of practically unlimited size and precision, and to implement the above procedures and the / procedure in such a way that they always return exact results when given exact arguments. If one of these procedures is unable to deliver an exact result when given exact arguments, then it may either report a violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently coerce its result to an inexact number. Such a coercion may cause an error later.</p><p>An implementation may use floating point and other approximate representation strategies for inexact numbers. This report recommends, but does not require, that the IEEE 32-bit and 64-bit floating point standards be followed by implementations that use flonum representations, and that implementations using other representations should match or exceed the precision achievable using these floating point standards [12].</p><p>In particular, implementations that use flonum representations must follow these rules: A flonum result must be represented with at least as much precision as is used to express any of the inexact arguments to that operation. It is desirable (but not required) for potentially inexact operations such as sqrt, when applied to exact arguments, to produce exact answers whenever possible (for example the square root of an exact 4 ought to be an exact 2). If, however, an exact number is operated upon so as to produce an inexact result (as by sqrt), and if the result is represented as a flonum, then the most precise flonum format available must be used; but if the result is represented in some other way then the representation must have at least as much precision as the most precise flonum format available.</p><p>Although Scheme allows a variety of written notations for numbers, any particular implementation may support only some of them. For example, an implementation in which all numbers are real need not support the rectangular and polar notations for complex numbers. If an implementation encounters an exact numerical constant that it cannot represent as an exact number, then it may either report a violation of an implementation restriction or it may silently represent the constant by an inexact number.</p><h4 id="sec:Syntax_of_numerical_constants"><a href="#sec:Syntax_of_numerical_constants">Syntax of numerical constants</a></h4><p>For a complete formal description of the syntax of the written representations for numbers, see the R5RS report. Note that case is not significant in numerical constants.</p><p>A number may be written in binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal by the use of a radix prefix. The radix prefixes are #b (binary), #o (octal), #d (decimal), and #x (hexadecimal). With no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be expressed in decimal.</p><p>A numerical constant may be specified to be either exact or inexact by a prefix. The prefixes are #e for exact, and #i for inexact. An exactness prefix may appear before or after any radix prefix that is used. If the written representation of a number has no exactness prefix, the constant may be either inexact or exact. It is inexact if it contains a decimal point, an exponent, or a &quot;#&quot; character in the place of a digit, otherwise it is exact. In systems with inexact numbers of varying precisions it may be useful to specify the precision of a constant. For this purpose, numerical constants may be written with an exponent marker that indicates the desired precision of the inexact representation. The letters s, f, d, and l specify the use of short, single, double, and long precision, respectively. (When fewer than four internal inexact representations exist, the four size specifications are mapped onto those available. For example, an implementation with two internal representations may map short and single together and long and double together.) In addition, the exponent marker e specifies the default precision for the implementation. The default precision has at least as much precision as double, but implementations may wish to allow this default to be set by the user.</p><pre>3.14159265358979F0

Pairs are created by the procedure cons. The car and cdr fields are accessed by the procedures car and cdr. The car and cdr fields are assigned by the procedures set-car! and set-cdr!.</p><p>Pairs are used primarily to represent lists. A list can be defined recursively as either the empty list or a pair whose cdr is a list. More precisely, the set of lists is defined as the smallest set X such that</p><ul><li>The empty list is in X.</li>
<li>If list is in X, then any pair whose cdr field contains list is also in X.</li>
</ul>
<p>The objects in the car fields of successive pairs of a list are the elements of the list. For example, a two-element list is a pair whose car is the first element and whose cdr is a pair whose car is the second element and whose cdr is the empty list. The length of a list is the number of elements, which is the same as the number of pairs.</p><p>The empty list is a special object of its own type (it is not a pair); it has no elements and its length is zero.</p><p>Note:   The above definitions imply that all lists have finite length and are terminated by the empty list.</p><p>The most general notation (external representation) for Scheme pairs is the &quot;dotted&quot; notation (c[1] . c[2]) where c[1] is the value of the car field and c[2] is the value of the cdr field. For example (4 . 5) is a pair whose car is 4 and whose cdr is 5. Note that (4 . 5) is the external representation of a pair, not an expression that evaluates to a pair.</p><p>A more streamlined notation can be used for lists: the elements of the list are simply enclosed in parentheses and separated by spaces. The empty list is written () . For example,</p><pre>(a b c d e)</pre><p>and</p><pre>(a . (b . (c . (d . (e . ())))))</pre><p>are equivalent notations for a list of symbols.</p><p>A chain of pairs not ending in the empty list is called an improper list. Note that an improper list is not a list. The list and dotted notations can be combined to represent improper lists:</p><pre>(a b c . d)</pre><p>is equivalent to</p><pre>(a . (b . (c . d)))</pre><p>Whether a given pair is a list depends upon what is stored in the cdr field. When the set-cdr! procedure is used, an object can be a list one moment and not the next:</p><pre>(define x (list 'a 'b 'c))

(list? x)                       ===&gt;  #f</pre><p>Within literal expressions and representations of objects read by the read procedure, the forms '&lt;datum&gt;, `&lt;datum&gt;, ,&lt;datum&gt;, and ,@&lt;datum&gt; denote two-element lists whose first elements are the symbols quote, quasiquote, unquote, and unquote-splicing, respectively. The second element in each case is &lt;datum&gt;. This convention is supported so that arbitrary Scheme programs may be represented as lists. That is, according to Scheme's grammar, every &lt;expression&gt; is also a &lt;datum&gt;. Among other things, this permits the use of the read procedure to parse Scheme programs.</p>

<dd class="defsig"><p>Proc must be a procedure of one argument. The procedure call-with-current-continuation packages up the current continuation (see the rationale below) as an &quot;escape procedure&quot; and passes it as an argument to proc. The escape procedure is a Scheme procedure that, if it is later called, will abandon whatever continuation is in effect at that later time and will instead use the continuation that was in effect when the escape procedure was created. Calling the escape procedure may cause the invocation of before and after thunks installed using dynamic-wind.</p><p>The escape procedure accepts the same number of arguments as the continuation to the original call to call-with-current-continuation.

The continuation represents an entire (default) future for the computation. If the expression is evaluated at top level, for example, then the continuation might take the result, print it on the screen, prompt for the next input, evaluate it, and so on forever. Most of the time the continuation includes actions specified by user code, as in a continuation that will take the result, multiply it by the value stored in a local variable, add seven, and give the answer to the top level continuation to be printed. Normally these ubiquitous continuations are hidden behind the scenes and programmers do not think much about them. On rare occasions, however, a programmer may need to deal with continuations explicitly. Call-with-current-continuation allows Scheme programmers to do that by creating a procedure that acts just like the current continuation.</p><p>Most programming languages incorporate one or more special-purpose escape constructs with names like exit, return, or even goto. In 1965, however, Peter Landin [16] invented a general purpose escape operator called the J-operator. John Reynolds [24] described a simpler but equally powerful construct in 1972. The catch special form described by Sussman and Steele in the 1975 report on Scheme is exactly the same as Reynolds's construct, though its name came from a less general construct in MacLisp. Several Scheme implementors noticed that the full power of the catch construct could be provided by a procedure instead of by a special syntactic construct, and the name call-with-current-continuation was coined in 1982. This name is descriptive, but opinions differ on the merits of such a long name, and some people use the name call/cc instead.</p></dd></dl>
